# 🧠 IP Address Analyzing System

This project was developed as my final year National Diploma (ND) project in Computer Science. It is a tool designed to **analyze IPv4**, identify their classes or types, and detect potential structural vulnerabilities. The system outputs results in both **graphical** and **tabular** formats to make the data easier to interpret.

## 🚀 Project Objective

To design and implement a system that:
- Accepts IPv4 and IPv6 addresses as input.
- Determines key characteristics (such as class, type, and range).
- Identifies potential limitations or conflicts.
- Provides visual and tabular representations of the results.
- Helps learners and IT professionals better understand IP addressing schemes.

## 📥 How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eyosam/IP-Address-Analyzing-System.git
   cd IP-Address-Analyzing-System/src

---

## Run the analysis

python IP1.py   # For IPv4 analysis
python IP2.py   # For IPv6 analysis
Make sure Python is installed. You may need to install additional libraries if required by the script
