# ES IP Address Calculator
An IP Address Calculator is a system that has very useful function within the Computing world. The users of this system comprises of but are not limited to the students and staff of Cross â€“ River Institute of Technology and Management (CR-ITM), Ugep, computing students all over the world, network instructors, as well as network engineers and administrators who may wish to use the system. The system takes an IP address and netmask and calculates the resulting broadcast, network, and host range. By providing a second netmask, you can design subnets. It is also intended to be a teaching tool and presents the sub-netting results as easy to understand binary values. This system is developed based on the problem/issues identified during the time of my Students Industrial Work Experience Scheme (SIWES), training at the CR-ITM, Ugep Computer Base Test (CBT) Centre. Before now, the computing students and staff of CR-ITM, Ugep have to manually calculate IP Addresses, a system that was cumbersome, time consuming, confusing, and even difficult. Hence, this system (IP Address Calculator) is developed to solve the above listed issues by automating the process of IP address calculation. The system is developed using the Python Programming Language and is in accordance to the proposed objectives outlined in chapter one of this project.
